# MongoDB $inc Operator Error

This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `$inc` operator in MongoDB update operations. The `$inc` operator is used to increment a numerical field by a specified value. However, providing a string value instead of a number results in an unexpected behavior or error. 

## Bug Description

The bug arises from the incorrect usage of the `$inc` operator within a MongoDB update statement.  Passing a string value to `$inc` where a number is expected prevents the intended atomic increment from occurring. The operation may fail silently or produce an unexpected outcome, potentially corrupting the data.

## Solution

Ensure you provide the correct data type for the increment value. A numerical value (integer or float) should be passed to the `$inc` operator. This ensures that the increment operation is performed correctly.
